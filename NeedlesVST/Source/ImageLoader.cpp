#include "ImageLoader.h"

// Stub implementation file for ImageLoader
// This file ensures the project compiles with the interfaces defined
// Concrete implementations will be created during user story phases

// Note: This file intentionally contains minimal implementation
// Full implementations will be created in:
// - Phase 3 (User Story 1): ImageLoader class with JUCE::Image integration
// - Phase 6 (Polish): Memory optimization and error handling

// For now, only the interface and data structures are available
