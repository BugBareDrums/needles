#include "PluginState.h"

// Stub implementation file for PluginState
// This file ensures the project compiles with the interfaces defined
// Concrete implementations will be created during user story phases

// Note: This file intentionally contains minimal implementation
// Full implementations will be created in:
// - Phase 6 (Polish): PluginState class for DAW project persistence
// - Phase 6 (Polish): Backward compatibility and state validation

// For now, only the interface and data structures are available
